# Tantrix_modeling
This project presents modeling and solving the Tantrix puzzle using integer programming. The Tantrix puzzle is a strategic tile-laying game that involves arranging hexagonal tiles to form loops or paths of a single color. The solution leverages integer programming techniques to find optimal tile arrangements.
